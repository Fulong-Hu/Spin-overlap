Extract Band Projection with PBE+SOC Calculation

Required Files:
Ensure you have the following files in your working directory:

FERMI_ENERGY (Fermi energy value)

POSCAR (crystal structure)

KPATH.in (k-point path for band structure)

PROCAR (projected wavefunction data)

Run the Python Script:
Execute the script with:

bash
python your_script_name.py
Follow the prompts to input required numerical values (e.g., 10).

Output:
The script will generate band projection data (e.g., band_projection.dat).
